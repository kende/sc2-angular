# Getting started with sc2-sdk

__1.a.__ If you are building your app with VueJS, install the sc2-sdk library in your application root directory with `npm i sc2-sdk --save`

__1.b.__ If not, you can use the sc2.min.js link for your `<script>` tag here:

https://steemit.github.io/sc2-angular/sc2.min.js

(If you aren't using NPM, check https://www.npmjs.com/package/sc2-sdk to verify that this is the most up to date version first.)

__2.__ Follow the step by step instructions on the official Steemit sc2-sdk repo for how to use Steem Connect 2 here:
